# Syscall-This

## Custom Kernel  Drivers
- A while back I told my grandfather that I only cared about quantum and DNA computing for syscalls
- Both are Domain Specific Applications (DSA) that really only count in certain aspects of our current programming paradigm
- Use DNA storage for off-disk, long-term storage
- Use Quantum for network/communications, database, and encryption purposes
- Use ASICs/FPGAs for DSP uses
- In-bar AI, currently called on-chip memory, for RAM/DRAM
- Everything state-of-the-art could be integrated into Linux 6.X without a problem: true hybrid quantum systems

## ATAK Meets Freedom
- ATAK was created by my enemies
- Now that I am free from slavery, UTAK will be better than lobbyist solutions: true innovation

## When Will This Happen
- Development has slowed due to governmental corruption
- End of year, should have some prototypes

### Join Dumbledore's Army
- Drink some Mead with me!
